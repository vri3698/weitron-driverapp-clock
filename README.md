# Driver clock in and clock out app


## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

*   `frontend/`: Contains the Frontend application code.
*   `backend/`: Contains the Node.js/Express server code to proxy Google Cloud API calls.

## Backend Environment Variables

The `backend/.env.local` file is automatically generated when you download this application.
It contains essential Google Cloud environment variables pre-configured based on your project settings at the time of download.

The variables set in `backend/.env.local` are:
*   `API_BACKEND_PORT`: The port the backend API server listens on (e.g., `5000`).
*   `API_PAYLOAD_MAX_SIZE`: The maximum size of the request payload accepted by the backend server (e.g., `5mb`).
*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`: The Google Cloud region associated with your project.
*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.

**Note:** These variables are automatically populated during the download process.
You can modify the values in `backend/.env.local` if you need to change them.
